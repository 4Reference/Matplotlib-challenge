Observations

1.) There is a difference between the IQR median for tumor volume and the median tumor volume per drug regime because the drug regime finding is of the median of significantly more records (1893 records) while the IQR median is only looking at the final Tumor volume (100 records).

2.) Correlation is an effect size and so we can verbally describe the strength of the correlation using the guide that Evans (1996) suggests for the absolute value of r:

.00-.19 “very weak”
.20-.39 “weak”
.40-.59 “moderate”
.60-.79 “strong”
.80-1.0 “very strong” 

So based on the results of "The correlation coefficient between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen is 0.84", we can say that there is a very strong positive correlation.

3.) More data digging would be required to see if there was a significant difference between the drugs effects on male vs female mice.
